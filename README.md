# Watermarker Adder Project

The Watermarker Adder project is a simple utility tool that allows users to add watermarks to images in a batch processing manner. Watermarks are often used to protect and brand images, making them more difficult to use without permission and adding a professional touch.

This tool provides an easy way to apply a watermark to multiple images simultaneously, saving time and effort compared to applying watermarks individually.

## Features
- Multiple formats supported: Supports popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
- Output quality: Control the quality and compression settings of the output images.
- Your Watermark will be adjusted based on the orignal image size automatically
- It gives You warning if Images are not set Properly!
